# Viatimages for Catima

Specific files for the customization of the [Viatimages](https://www2.unil.ch/viatimages/) catalog.

- If a catalog with the viatimages slug is available in Catima, the views in the catalogs/viatimages folder will override those in the app.
- New locale files for this catalog are also available and should be added to the app standard directory (config/locales).

[Work in progress]
